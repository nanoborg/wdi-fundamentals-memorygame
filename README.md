### Try here ðŸ‘‰ [Memory Game](https://nanoborg.github.io/wdi-fundamentals-memorygame/)

## Intention

This was part of my pre course material designed to get my familiar with programming languages such as:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Game Play

The game is simply to match 2 cards and show a prompt.

## Code

The way the code is designed is to use **HTML** to create a basic layout and have **Javascript** target the **HTML** to handle creating elements and game-play logic.

In `main.js` a function creates elements based off the data stored in an object. This utilizes one `back.png` for all cards.

There is a flip functions which looks at data stored in the element to determine which image to show and to see if there is a match.

## Extended Features

- implemented a guard clause to stop the program from thinking there is match when you click the same card twice.

- implemented board reset after a game is won or lost, also adjusted the confirm dialogue to show after the card images have been updated.

- adjusted the formatting so the footer sits on the bottom of the page.

## Problems

The only problem I was facing was with deployment to github, specifically with the **images**.

I had to make sure the src path to the images was relative to the `index.html` file and not the `main.js` file where the code to create the `img` tag exists.

for instance, the file structure is like this below:

```
repo_root/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ filename.png
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html

```

I thought the image src within `main.js` would be `../images/filename.png`, where in fact the image src needs to be relative to the `index.html` file, `./images/filename`.
